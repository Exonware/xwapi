## Purpose of This Document

This document is the **single source of raw and refined requirements** collected from the project sponsor and stakeholders. It is updated on every requirements-gathering run. When the **Clarity Checklist** (section 12) reaches the agreed threshold, use this content to fill REF_11_COMP, REF_12_IDEA, REF_22_PROJECT, REF_13_ARCH, REF_14_DX, REF_15_API, and REF_21_PLAN (planning artifacts). Template structure: [GUIDE_01_REQ.md](../../docs/guides/GUIDE_01_REQ.md).

## 1. Vision and Goals

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| One-sentence purpose | xwlazy makes development easier for developers by automatically installing missing libraries and doing lazy loading - just add or enable xwlazy and it does lazy installation; no need to be an expert. It also optimizes memory. |
| Primary users/beneficiaries | People who want to try things out very quickly; developers; people who want to optimize memory and not install everything, using only part of a library. |
| Success (6 mo / 1 yr) | Success is already achieved when it silently installs the required library in the background and runs instead of throwing an error. First-time run performance is not the priority. |
| Top 3–5 goals (ordered) | 1) Very reliable run - don't crash, run and install what's missing (the whole purpose); 2) Handle both virtual environment and PC (normal) environment; 3) Extensible mapping of libraries to what they originally are (e.g. via TOML). |
| Problem statement | Other ecosystems need an IDE or AI to understand what library is missing; xwlazy installs the missing library automatically, regardless of AI or IDE. |

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

| In scope | Out of scope | Dependencies | Anti-goals |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Full implementation for virtual environment and normal (PC) environment; local TOML that xwlazy uses; use of requirements configuration; all existing features documented in the project docs. | Complete Python rewrite; changing the way Python runs; more than one file - keep it simple, single file, ~3000 lines maximum. | Python 3.11+: stdlib only (tomllib for TOML). Python &lt; 3.11: optional tomli for TOML reading; default install on 3.11+ has zero external deps. TOML: reading from config/manifest; minimal writing for SBOM and lockfile only. | No complex compiler; do not solve all existing libs in a lazy way - only critical and famous ones; we will not solve libs that have similar names or that are not famous. |

## 3. Stakeholders and Sponsor

| Sponsor (name, role, final say) | Main stakeholders | External customers/partners | Doc consumers |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| eXonware (company); developer and owner: eXonware Backend Team (same person). Final say on scope and priorities. Priority: simple and focused; Python only for now. | Mainly technical teams working on eXonware projects. Maybe in future: open source or available for others - very useful and doesn't exist elsewhere. | None currently. Maybe in future: sponsor Python and introduce library as company achievement; offer options to change TOML configuration so users whose libraries aren't in the default set can add them (flexibility to change TOML when using xwlazy). | Mainly developers and internal team at eXonware; AI agents for developers (e.g. Cursor, Cloud Code). |

## 4. Compliance and Standards

| Regulatory/standards | Security & privacy | Certifications/evidence |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| To be implemented at a later stage (e.g. before converting library to Rust). If lazy installation violates standards we may not need the library; for now and current versions, keep as is. | No special requirements; handled internally by xwlazy. Developers who use the library are responsible. | None needed. SOC2 or similar only if Python library is used in production and client or government requires such documentation. |

## 5. Product and User Experience

| Main user journeys/use cases | Developer persona & 1–3 line tasks | Usability/accessibility | UX/DX benchmarks |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| User enables xwlazy; when they run code, if any import/library is missing, xwlazy intervenes and installs automatically. That's it. | Developer: just enable xwlazy, nothing else—minimal. | Usable for any library; accessed easily by just enabling xwlazy. | When installing the library, users add brackets [lazy] and it automatically enables xwlazy. |

## 6. API and Surface Area

| Main entry points / "key code" | Easy (1–3 lines) vs advanced | Integration/existing APIs | Not in public API |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Configuration to enable or disable—that simple. One line to enable. | One line to enable. If more config needed: extremely configurable (e.g. change TOML, create custom mappings). | Should integrate with anything. | Only expose what's useful for users (enable, disable, config). Do not expose internal implementation. |

## 7. Architecture and Technology

| Required/forbidden tech | Preferred patterns | Scale & performance | Multi-language/platform |
|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Python only. No databases; just a TOML file at runtime. | Facade (one file, simple); facade + some advanced async. | Expect faster than whatever is in the market. | Multi-platform: Windows, Linux, venv—all environments. Rust later: different model (Python = script runtime, Rust = compiled; in Rust everything set before run). |

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements (Five Priorities)

| Security | Usability | Maintainability | Performance | Extensibility |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Managed internally; no need to bother. | Docs enough to explain how to use; no need for more. | Testing is huge—unit, integration, all testing the guide requires; we must do it. | Max 1% delay with lazy on vs off (or less). Expect zero delay: xwlazy not executed unless there's an import error. | Has plugins/hooks/version/compatibility; for now one file, simple, does the job. Extensible yet one file, simple, no failure. |

## 9. Milestones and Timeline

| Major milestones | Definition of done (first) | Fixed vs flexible |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| (1) xwlazy able to load libraries - done; (2) able to lazy install - done. | Done = in production, used, never fails, passes every test where libraries are missing. | Both milestones done. |

## 10. Risks and Assumptions

| Top risks | Assumptions | Kill/pivot criteria |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Infinite loop or circular referencing/installation that never ends; installing in the wrong environment than the one running. | Users understand xwlazy will not install every custom library—Python allows multiple libs/modules with the same name; we cannot support that unless languages change. | If Python adds lazy installation to the language (the correct way), we will not need this; for now we need it. |
