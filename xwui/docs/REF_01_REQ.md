## 1. Vision and Goals

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| One-sentence purpose | **xwui** is an **advanced, native TypeScript UI component library** that provides multi-framework, high-performance components and sub‑apps (Component/Power/Super tiers) for the eXonware ecosystem, with clear theming/tokens and Firebase-like frontend parity where applicable. |
| Primary users/beneficiaries | eXonware frontend and full‑stack developers; internal app teams building UIs on xwauth, xwstorage, xwchat, xwapi/xwai; external adopters who want framework‑agnostic, TS‑native components; AI agents that need a well-structured UI library. |
| Success (6 mo / 1 yr) | **6 mo:** Stable core Component tier and key Power/Super components; runnable examples in `examples/` for 30+ frameworks (see REF_12_IDEA); Firebase frontend parity table defined and partially implemented (Hosting, Auth UI, data UI, Functions/API). **12 mo:** Xwui used across multiple eXonware apps and example stacks; clearly documented component taxonomy and themes; parity areas implemented to a “good enough to migrate from Firebase frontend” level. |
| Top 3–5 goals (ordered) | 1) Provide a **TS‑native, multi‑framework UI component set** that stands on its own (Component/Power/Super tiers). 2) Deliver a **strong theming/tokens system** (styles, roundness, colors) that separates skeleton from theme. 3) Enable **Firebase frontend parity** for Hosting UI, Auth UI, data UI, and Functions/API on the frontend side. 4) Maintain **high performance** and efficient DOM updates (design goal) across components. 5) Keep **docs and examples** aligned so adopters can use xwui quickly in multiple frameworks. |
| Problem statement | No single **TypeScript‑native, framework‑agnostic UI library** today offers a coherent Component/Power/Super model, centralized theming/tokens, broad framework support via Custom Elements/wrappers, and a clear path to **replace Firebase frontend UX** (Hosting/Auth/data/Functions) within an ecosystem like eXonware. xwui fills that gap. |

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

| In scope | Out of scope | Dependencies | Anti-goals |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Components:** Core components, Power components, Super components as described in REF_12_IDEA (buttons, inputs, grids, editors, form builders, sub‑apps, etc.). **Theming & tokens:** Styles, roundness, colors, typography, brand tokens; separation of skeleton vs theme. **Framework support:** Usage in vanilla JS and via Custom Elements/wrappers in major frameworks. Runnable examples in `examples/` for 30+ frameworks and stacks (Alpine.js, Angular, Astro, Aurelia, Backbone, Dojo, Eleventy, Ember, Fresh, Gatsby, htmx, Hyperapp, jQuery, Knockout, Lit, Marko, Mithril, Next, Nuxt, Petite-Vue, Preact, Qwik, React, Remix, Riot, Solid, Stencil, Stimulus, Svelte, SvelteKit, Vanilla, Vue). See REF_12_IDEA (“Target: Works With (Frameworks)” and “Runnable examples”). **Firebase frontend parity:** Frontend/UI parity areas (Hosting, Auth UI, data UI, Functions/API) as a requirements target, coordinated with xwauth, xwstorage/xwchat, xwapi/xwai/xwaction. **Docs & tooling:** Compliance reports, testers, docs under `docs/`, and build tooling needed to support the library. | Implementing backend logic (auth, storage, chat, API servers) inside xwui; owning data persistence or business logic; being the only way to build UIs in eXonware; providing a full CMS or app platform beyond components and sub‑apps; defining backend Firebase parity (that belongs to xwauth, xwstorage, xwchat, xwapi, etc.). | xwauth / xwauth‑server, xwstorage, xwchat, xwapi, xwai‑server, xwaction; xwsystem/xwbase foundations; frontend toolchain (TypeScript, Vite, bundlers), browsers and framework runtimes. | Lock‑in to a single frontend framework; duplicating backend features of xwauth/xwstorage/xwchat/xwapi; mixing backend concerns into the UI library; abandoning TypeScript‑first design or Custom Elements‑friendly architecture. |

## 3. Stakeholders and Sponsor

| Sponsor (name, role, final say) | Main stakeholders | External customers/partners | Doc consumers |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| eXonware.com; Eng. Muhammad AlShehri (author, maintainer, final say on scope and priorities). | eXonware frontend and full‑stack teams; owners of xwauth, xwstorage, xwchat, xwapi/xwai, xwentity/xwdata/xwbase that rely on UI components; CI/QA owners for UI compliance. | Future: open‑source adopters; teams building apps that want TS‑native UI components and Firebase‑like frontend behavior. | Developers and internal eXonware teams; AI agents; downstream REF_12/REF_22/REF_13/REF_15 owners; external adopters reading docs and examples. |

## 4. Compliance and Standards

| Regulatory/standards | Security & privacy | Certifications/evidence |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Same as eXonware norm; no extra regulatory standards beyond general web/frontend quality and accessibility expectations. | Standard frontend security hygiene (no credential storage in UI, safe handling of tokens from xwauth/xwapi; avoid XSS by design; follow eXonware security guidance from backend libs). | No special certifications expected for the UI library itself; evidence is via compliance reports, test logs, and REF_* docs. |

## 5. Product and User Experience

| Main user journeys/use cases | Developer persona & 1–3 line tasks | Usability/accessibility | UX/DX benchmarks |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| (1) Drop xwui components into an app (vanilla or framework) with minimal setup. (2) Style an app using xwui themes/tokens (colors, roundness, typography) without rewriting components. (3) Embed Super components (forms, workflows, editors, etc.) as sub‑apps. (4) Build Firebase‑like frontend flows: hosting‑ready UIs, auth flows, data browsing, and function triggers using eXonware backends. (5) Use xwui consistently across multiple frameworks in the same ecosystem. | Frontend / full‑stack developer who wants **TS‑native, framework‑agnostic components**: import or register xwui, pass a JSON config + data object, and get useful UI in **1–3 lines**; adjust theme via tokens; wire events to existing backend APIs. | Components should be consistent, predictable, and themeable; reasonable default accessibility (ARIA, focus states) where applicable; docs and examples that show minimal but complete usage. | Competes or coexists with systems like MUI, Chakra, Ant Design, Radix, shadcn/ui, and Prime* libraries, but with **TS‑native, multi‑framework, JSON‑driven** emphasis and Firebase‑style frontend parity for the eXonware ecosystem. |

## 6. API and Surface Area

| Main entry points / "key code" | Easy (1–3 lines) vs advanced | Integration/existing APIs | Not in public API |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| TypeScript modules exporting components and helpers; Custom Elements registration for components; JSON‑driven configuration (schema + conf_sys/conf_usr/conf_comp + data); theming/tokens APIs (styles, colors, roundness); framework wrappers or integration helpers where needed. | **Easy:** Render a component or Super component with configuration + data in a few lines; load a theme and apply to app; wire a button/form to an HTTP endpoint. **Advanced:** Deep customization of Super components, custom data bindings, advanced event handling, framework‑specific optimizations. | xwui sits on top of xwauth, xwstorage/xwchat, xwapi/xwai/xwaction, consuming their APIs; it should not redefine their contracts but provide UI over them. Integration with bundlers/frameworks uses standard Web Components and module systems. | Internal build scripts and low‑level implementation details that are not stable; experimental APIs not yet documented in REF_15_API; any backend logic that belongs in xwauth/xwstorage/xwchat/xwapi. |

## 7. Architecture and Technology

| Required/forbidden tech | Preferred patterns | Scale & performance | Multi-language/platform |
|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Required: TypeScript, Web Components/Custom Elements, CSS variables/themes; compatibility with major frontend frameworks via CE/wrappers; build via Vite or similar modern tools. Forbidden: hard‑tying xwui to a single framework runtime; backend‑only technologies inside the core library. | Component/Power/Super tiers, base component with schema + config + data, separation of skeleton vs theme, JSON‑driven configuration, facade/helpers for common patterns. | Should be suitable for modern SPAs and hybrid apps; aim for efficient DOM updates and reasonable bundle sizes; “high performance” is a design goal reflected in component patterns and build output. | Target: browsers and hybrid shells (Capacitor/Electron/Tauri/PWA) where TS and Web Components run; multi‑framework consumption (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, etc.) via CE/wrappers. |

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements (Five Priorities)

| Security | Usability | Maintainability | Performance | Extensibility |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Follow standard frontend security practices; do not store secrets in UI; integrate safely with xwauth/xwapi tokens. | DX should be good enough that common usage is obvious from docs and examples; configuration schema and theming should be understandable without reading all internals. | Clear component taxonomy and folder structure; REF_* kept in sync with code; compliance reports and testers to prevent regressions. | Components should be reasonably lightweight and fast; design encourages fine‑grained updates per component where possible. | Easy to add new components and themes; Super components should be composable and configurable via JSON without forks. |

## 9. Milestones and Timeline

| Major milestones | Definition of done (first) | Fixed vs flexible |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| M1: Core Component tier and themes stable; examples for main frameworks. M2: Key Power/Super components available and documented. M3: Firebase frontend parity table in REF_22 filled and first parity areas (Auth UI, Hosting UI) implemented in real examples. | First milestone is “xwui can be dropped into a simple app (vanilla + at least one major framework) with documented components and themes, and basic Auth UI + Hosting UI flows exist using eXonware backends.” | Scope (TS‑native multi‑framework UI, themes/tokens, Firebase frontend parity as a goal) is more fixed; exact dates and detailed parity coverage are flexible and can evolve. |

## 10. Risks and Assumptions

| Top risks | Assumptions | Kill/pivot criteria |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| (1) Scope creep from trying to match every Firebase and competitor feature on the frontend. (2) Complexity of supporting many frameworks while keeping a single codebase. (3) Performance and bundle size bloat from too many Super components or dependencies. | eXonware backends (xwauth, xwstorage, xwchat, xwapi/xwai) continue to evolve and provide the capabilities xwui builds UIs over; TypeScript/Web Components remain viable across target frameworks. | If ecosystem direction moves away from a shared UI library or from TS/Web Components, or if parity/complexity trade‑offs make a generic library less valuable than framework‑specific ones. |
